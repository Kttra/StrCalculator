# StrCalculator
The program is built assuming that there will be spaces between the operator and operands in the input. It can
accept fractions, negative numbers, and positive numbers. The program can take in a string of the form
"1 + 2 =" and produces the result.

Details:
1. Simple arithmetic operators should be supported (i.e. +, -, *, /)
2. At least two operands are supported.
3. Operands can be fractional or whole numbers.
4. Operands can be negative or positive.
